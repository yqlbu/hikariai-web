My name is Kevin Yu. I graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering with a concentration on Technology Innovation. As an AI enthusiast, I love technology ranging from Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Cloud Computing, Containerization Technology, Serverless Application, and Robotics. More recently, I am actively building resilient microservices and scalable infrastructure, in the meanwhile I am also actively involved in building large-scale enterprise-level serverless applications.

I am a DevOps Engineer, a Cloud Solution Architect, and a Cloud Native Advocate. Through my speaking, writing, and analysis, I help businesses take advantage of emerging technologies. I am glad to be recognized as a Developer for Cloud and IoT, a Software Innovator, and a Cloud Native Computing Foundation ambassador. To keep myself relevant and current, I regularly pursue industry certifications. I plan to get the CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) hopefully by the end of 2021.

I started learning Machine Learning about four years ago and since then I learned about lots of Machine Learning topics and worked on multiple projects including building a Self Driving Car with computer vision technology and a Private Cloud Server with computing capabilities.

I hope you could find something helpful from my site for your own projects!
