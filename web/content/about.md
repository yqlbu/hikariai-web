My name is Kevin Yu. I graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering with a concentration on Technology Innovation. As a technology enthusiast, I love technology ranging from Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Federal Learning, DevSecOps, CICD, Networking, CloudNative Technology, Containerization Technology, Serverless Application, and Robotics. I build resilient microservices and scalable infrastructure for enterprises on premise or on the cloud. Security is always my first priority concern when it comes to cloud adoption.

I am a Sr. SRE (Senior Site Reliablity Engineer), a Cloud Solution Architect, and a Cloud Native Advocate. Through my speaking, writing, and analysis, I help enterprises take advantage of emerging technologies. I am glad to be recognized as an Open-Source Developer, a Solution Architect, a DevOps Engineer, and a Cloud Native Computing Foundation ambassador. To keep myself relevant and current, I regularly pursue industry certifications. Currently, I was successfully certified as a CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator), a CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer), and a CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Speclialist).

My technical expertise includes cross-platform proficiency (Unix and Linux), fluency in 10+ scripting/programming languages, and advanced knowledge of developing applications, tools, methodologies followed by the best practices in the industry. I also have experience in designing event-driven systems with FaaS (Function as a Service) and CaaS (Container as a Service). With years of study in Containerization and Cloud Native, I constantly develop new designs for technical projects, thereby improving the organization’s ability to scale faster, debug more efficiently, and release software more frequently.

I hope you could find something helpful from my site for your own projects! Feel free to visit the Github pages below for more information.
