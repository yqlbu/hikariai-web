In the upcoming months and years, I want to help make learning Machine Learning and Cloud Computing topics easier by writing lots of articles showing of practice cases on Cloud and Edge devices.

Furthermore, Iâ€™m planning on creating an AI and Cloud Technology community so that people can interact with each other and learn together.
